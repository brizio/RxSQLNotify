RxSQLNotify=======RxSQLNotify leverages SqlDependency by creating reactive notifications to table changes.Its use is quite simple: create a SqlConnection and then observe the changes for a specific SQL Statement by using the Observe extension method.    var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString);    connection.Observe("select field1, field2 from dbo.MyTable").Subscribe(NotifyTableChanged);
